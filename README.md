## Pull request description generator
A GitHub action and command-line tool that generates pull request descriptions from Conventional Commit messages,
stopping at the specified stop point. The description can be used to create release notes. The stop point can be one of:
* The first commit of the pull request - `PULL_REQUEST_START`
* The last semantically-versioned release tagged in the git history relative to the checked-out branch - `LAST_RELEASE`

If breaking changes are indicated in any of the commit messages' bodies via `BREAKING CHANGE` or `BREAKING-CHANGE`,
these commits are marked and a warning is added to the top of the release notes.

Previous pull request descriptions can be provided to allow continual updating of the same notes. If these notes contain
the comment lines `<!--- START AUTOGENERATED NOTES --->` and `<!--- END AUTOGENERATED NOTES --->`, only the text between
these will be replaced - anything outside of this will remain untouched in the new release notes, allowing
static/user-updated sections of the notes alongside the automatically generated section. Auto-generated updates can be
skipped for future commits if `<!--- SKIP AUTOGENERATED NOTES --->` is added anywhere in the pull request description.
Note that these comment lines are invisible in rendered markdown.

### GitHub action
The generator can easily be used as a step in a GitHub workflow:

```yaml
steps:
- uses: actions/checkout@v3

- uses: octue/generate-pull-request-description@1.0.0
  with:
    pull_request_url: ${{ github.event.pull_request.url }}
    api_token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}

- name: Update pull request body
  uses: riskledger/update-pr-description@v2
  with:
    body: ${{ env.RELEASE_NOTES }}
    token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}

```

### CLI
```shell
usage: generate-pull-request-description [-h] [--pull-request-url PULL_REQUEST_URL] [--api-token API_TOKEN] [--header HEADER] [--list-item-symbol LIST_ITEM_SYMBOL] [--no-link-to-pull-request] {LAST_RELEASE,PULL_REQUEST_START}

positional arguments:
  {LAST_RELEASE,PULL_REQUEST_START}
                        The point in the git history to stop compiling commits into the pull request description.

options:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  --pull-request-url PULL_REQUEST_URL
                        Provide the API URL of a pull request (e.g. https://api.github.com/repos/octue/conventional-commits/pulls/1) if you want to update a pull request's description with the generated release notes. It must be
                        provided alongside --api-token if the repository is private.
  --api-token API_TOKEN
                        A valid GitHub API token for the repository the pull request belongs to. There is no need to provide this if the repository is public.
  --header HEADER       The header (including MarkDown styling) to put the release notes under. Default is '# Contents'
  --list-item-symbol LIST_ITEM_SYMBOL
                        The MarkDown list item symbol to use for listing commit messages in the release notes. Default is '- '
  --no-link-to-pull-request
                        If provided, don't add a link to the given pull request in the release notes.

```
